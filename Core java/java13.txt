Import statement
================
Whenever we use import statement we should not use fully qualified name.

Using short name also we can achieve.

We have three types of import statements.

1) Explicit class import 

2) Implicit class import 

3) Static import

1) Explicit class import
-------------------------
This type of import statement is highly recommanded to use because it improves readability of our code.
