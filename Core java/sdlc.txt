SDLC
=====
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.

SDLC is a process adopt by IT industries to develop accurate and quality of softwares.

There are six phases in SDLC.

1) Feasibility study 

2) Analysis 

3) Designing 

4) Coding 

5) Testing 

6) Delivery and Maintainence


1) Feasibility study 
---------------------
Feasibility study depends upon TELOS formulea.
ex:
	T - Technical feasibility
	E - Economical feasibility 
	L - Legal Feasibility 
	O - Operational Feasibility
	S - Schedule Feasibility  

All the above information they will keep in a document called BDD.

BDD stands for Business Design Document.


2) Analysis 
-------------
In analysis phase, system analyst or product owner will involved.

They will seperate system requirements and software requirements.

All the above information they will keep in a document called SRS.

SRS stands for Software Requirement Specification.
3) Designing 
--------------
We have two types of desinging.

1) High level designing 
------------------------
	In high level designing we will design main modules.

	A manager is responsible to perform high level designing.
	

2) Low level designing 
-----------------------
	In low level designing we will design child/sub modules.

	A team lead is responsible to perform low level designing.

All the information they will keep in a document called PDD/TDD.

PDD stands for Project Design Document.
TDD stands for Technical Design Document. 


4) Coding 
--------------
In coding phase developers will involved.

Developers are responsible to generate the build and to perform unit testing.


5) Testing 
---------------
In testing phase testing team or QA team will involved.

They will perform testing to our code by using a software component called STLC and makes our project as bug free.

STLC stands for Software Testing Life cycle.


6) Delivery and Maintainence
---------------------------
Before delivery they will perform UAT testing.

UAT stands User Acceptance Testing.

It is divided into two types.

i) Alpha testing 

ii) Beta testing
