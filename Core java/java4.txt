Comments in Java
================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve redability of our code.

It is highly recommanded to use comments in regular programming.

Diagram: java4.1

Comments will not display in output because they won't compiled by the compiler.

In java, comments are divided into two types.

1) Single Line Comment 

2) Multiple Line Comment 


1) Single Line Comment 
----------------------
It is used to comment a single line.
ex:
	// comment here 


2) Multiple Line Comment 
-------------------------
It is used to comment multiple lines.
ex:
	/*
		-
		- comment here 
		-
	*/

ex:
----

//class declaration 
class Example
{
	//main method 
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		//variable declaration 
		int n=123;

		//sum of digits logic 
		int rem,sum=0;
		while(n!=0)
		{
			rem=n%10;
			sum=sum+rem;
			n=n/10;			
		}	
		
		//output stmt
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

Q) What is difference between JDK, JRE and JVM?


JDK
-----
JDK stands for Java Development Kit.

JDK is a installable software which consist Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Java Virtual Machine (JVM), compiler (javac) , interpreter (java), an archiever (.jar) , document generator (javadoc) and other tools needed for java application development.

JRE
----
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
JRE provides very good environment to run java applications only.

JVM
----
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
JVM is an interpreter which is used to execute our program line by line procedure.
