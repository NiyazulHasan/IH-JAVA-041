Comments in Java
================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

It is highly recommanded to use comments in regular programming.

Diagram : java4.1

Comments will not display in output because they won't compiled by the compiler.

In java, we have two types of comments.

1) Single line comment 
--------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 


2) Multiple line comment 
------------------------
	It is used to comment multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			- comment here 
			-
		*/

ex:
---
//class declaration 
class Test
{

	//main method	
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		//variable declaration 
		int sum=0;

		//sum of 10 natural numbers logic
		for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
		{
			sum+=i;
		}

		//display the result
		System.out.println(sum);
	}
}

Interview Questions
====================

Q) How many modules are there in java?

There are three modules in java.

1) JSE/J2SE (Java Standard Edition)

2) JEE/J2EE (Java Enterprise Edition)

3) JME/J2ME (Java Micro Edition)


Q) What is the difference between JDK, JRE and JVM ?

JDK 
----
JDK stands for Java Development Kit.

It is a installable software which consist Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Java Virtual Machine (JVM),
compiler (javac) , interpreter (java), an archiever (.jar) , document generator (javadoc) and other tools needed for java application development.

JRE
----
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
It provides very good environment to run java applications only.

JVM
----
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
JVM is an interpreter which is used to execute our program line by line procedure.
